## Working locally

To run locally, make sure you have the latest yarn installed with node version 8+.

```sh
  yarn install
  yarn dev
```

After running the above commands in your terminal, you'll have a local server running your application. Now go to http://localhost:3000/ to see it.

## Creating the application

The master branch contains the all the setup required to get started on building an application. It uses Nextjs for a quick and easy project setup. Nextjs requires that all components relating to a route are placed inside the pages folder and all other re-usable components be inside the components folder. As this task only requires one route, your entry point will be `./pages/index.js`. You can refer to the `final` branch to see how I've completed the task but try to make it in your own way.

## Working with styled-components

[Styled-components](https://www.styled-components.com/) is a css-in-js library that generates React components with custom styles. It uses a very similar syntax to sass.
